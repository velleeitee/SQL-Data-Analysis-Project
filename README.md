# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
üìä Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores üí∞ top-paying jobs, üî• in-demand skills, and üìà where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim ON
    job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'  AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 
    10
;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

By balancing these factors, the ranking reflects the best skills to invest in‚Äînot only offering high salaries but also ensuring strong job prospects.
‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

While this method enhances accuracy, it's important to interpret the results within a broader industry context:
* üìâ **Rapid tech evolution** ‚Äì Some high-demand skills may shift as new technologies emerge.
* üìä **Dataset scope** ‚Äì A larger dataset across multiple industries would further refine these insights.
* üõ† **Industry specialization** ‚Äì The best skill for you depends on your specific career path (e.g., AI, DevOps, Cloud, etc.).
## üöÄ *Final Thoughts*

This analysis provides a roadmap for skill development, highlighting which technologies are both lucrative and in high demand. For professionals and learners, mastering these skills can lead to high-paying roles and strong career stability in today‚Äôs evolving tech landscape.
